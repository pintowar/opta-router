Sample CVRP Application using Kotlin + Optaplanner/Timefold/Jsprit/Or-Tools/Jenetics + Graphhopper + Spring Boot + Websockets

This sample application uses the belgium map to calculate distances between points. The map can be found on this [link](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/belgium-latest.osm.pbf). Download it and point the Env `GRAPH_OSM_PATH` to it's path, in order to run the application.
The `GRAPH_OSM_LOCATION` Env must point to a temporary folder, in order to Graphhopper folder.

Both Envs can be customized on the `application.yml` file.

## Run in development mode

This project is divided in 2 sub modules:

### Server

To run the server module, run on server folder:

    gradle bootRun

This command will run a Spring Boot application on port `8080`.

### Client

To run the client module, make sure you have node and yarn installed on your system, then run on client folder:

    npm run dev

Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. This module will run on port `3000`, but will proxy remote calls to port `8080`.

### Both Modules

Gradle can run both modules together

    gradle bootRun -parallel

This task will run both modules on port `3000` and `8080`.

## Build assembled jar

To build a jar that contains both server and client modules assembled on the same app. Just run the task on the root folder:

    gradle assembleServerAndClient

This will generate a jar named `app.jar` on the `build` folder. To run the generated app, then run `GRAPH_OSM_PATH=<path_to_osm_map> GRAPH_OSM_LOCATION=<path_to_graphhopper_folder> java -jar app.jar`.

## Docker

A full packaged docker image can be found at Dockerhub. In order to run the sample, you have to download the belgim OSM map and add the envs config mentioned above.

To run a working sample of opta-router image, run the following commands:

```shell
mkdir -p /tmp/osm/gh-tmp
wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/belgium-latest.osm.pbf -P /tmp/osm

docker run --rm -e GRAPH_OSM_PATH=/tmp/osm/belgium-latest.osm.pbf -e GRAPH_OSM_LOCATION=/tmp/osm/gh-tmp -v /tmp/osm:/tmp/osm -p 8080:8080 pintowar/opta-router
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
